# MPI-Parallel-Processing-Website
## MPI Parallel Data Processing Demo

This project is a web-based demo for parallel data processing using MPI (Message Passing Interface) and Python. It allows users to run various data processing tasks (like sorting, word count, image filtering, linear regression, keyword search, statistics, and matrix multiplication) in parallel, comparing performance to sequential execution. The user interface is built with Streamlit, and the backend leverages mpi4py for MPI operations.

---

## Features

- **Multiple Tasks:** Sorting, Word Count, Image Filtering, Linear Regression, Keyword Search, Statistics, Matrix Multiplication.
- **Parallel Execution:** Choose the number of MPI processes (2â€“32) to see the speedup over sequential processing.
- **User-Friendly Web UI:** Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Performance Comparison:** Displays execution time and speedup between sequential and parallel runs.

## How It Works (Backend Explanation)

### **A. Sequential vs. Parallel Execution**

- For each task, there are two implementations:
  - **Sequential:** Runs in a single process, used as a baseline.
  - **Parallel (MPI):** The data is split among multiple processes using mpi4py, and the results are combined at the end[1].

### **B. Task Execution Flow**

1. **User Input:** Data and parameters are collected from the UI.
2. **Sequential Run:** The task is executed in the main process for benchmarking.
3. **Parallel Run:** The app spawns an MPI job using `mpiexec` with the selected number of processes. The actual computation is distributed across processes, and results are gathered on the root process.
4. **Results & Timing:** Both results and timings are displayed, allowing users to compare performance.

## C. Task Execution Flow and Parallelization Details

This section explains, for each supported task, how the backend executes both the sequential and parallel (MPI) versions, including how data is split, processed, and aggregated.

---

### **C.1 Sorting**

- **Data Split:** The input array is divided into equal chunks, one for each MPI process.
- **Local Computation:** Each process sorts its assigned chunk independently using a sorting algorithm (e.g., MergeSort).
- **Aggregation:** The sorted subarrays are sent to the master process, which merges them to produce the final sorted result.

---

### **C.2 Word Count**

- **Data Split:** The input text file is partitioned into sections, one per MPI process, ensuring words are not split at boundaries.
- **Local Computation:** Each process counts the occurrences of words in its section, storing results in a local hash table.
- **Aggregation:** All local hash tables are sent to the master process, which merges them to obtain the total word counts.

---

### **C.3 Image Filter**

- **Data Split:** The image is sliced horizontally, with each slice assigned to a different MPI process.
- **Local Computation:** Each process applies the selected image filter (e.g., grayscale, blur) to its slice.
- **Aggregation:** Filtered slices are sent to the master process, which combines them to reconstruct the complete filtered image.

---

### **C.4 Linear Regression**

- **Data Split:** The dataset is divided among processes, with each handling a subset of rows.
- **Local Computation:** Each process computes partial sums required for the regression calculation.
- **Aggregation:** Partial results are sent to the master process, which aggregates them to compute the final regression coefficients.

---

### **C.5 Keyword Search**

- **Data Split:** The input text is divided into segments, one per MPI process.
- **Local Computation:** Each process searches for the keyword in its segment, recording matches and their positions.
- **Aggregation:** Results from all processes are collected by the master process and combined to form the complete list of occurrences.

---

### **C.6 Statistics**

- **Data Split:** The dataset (e.g., CSV file) is divided by rows among the processes.
- **Local Computation:** Each process computes statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.) for its subset.
- **Aggregation:** The master process combines the partial statistics from all processes to produce overall dataset statistics.

---

### **C.7 Matrix Multiplication**

- **Data Split:** The two input matrices are divided into blocks or rows, with each process assigned a portion.
- **Local Computation:** Each process performs matrix multiplication on its assigned blocks.
- **Aggregation:** The resulting blocks are sent to the master process, which assembles them into the final result matrix.

## Notes

- **Performance:** Speedup depends on the size of the data and the number of MPI processes. For small datasets, parallel overhead may outweigh benefits.
- **MPI Environment:** The app must be run in an environment where `mpiexec` is available and properly configured.
- **Platform:** Tested on Linux; some MPI implementations may behave differently on Windows.

---

## Extending the Project

- Add new data processing tasks by implementing both sequential and MPI versions.
- Improve front-end with more visualizations or input validation.
- Add support for larger datasets and streaming data.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to MPI, ensure your MPI installation is working (try `mpiexec -n 2 python -c "from mpi4py import MPI; print(MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())"`).
- For Python dependency issues, check your environment and reinstall required packages.
