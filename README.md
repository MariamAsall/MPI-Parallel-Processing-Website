# MPI-Parallel-Processing-Website
## MPI Parallel Data Processing Demo

This project is a web-based demo for parallel data processing using MPI (Message Passing Interface) and Python. It allows users to run various data processing tasks (like sorting, word count, image filtering, linear regression, keyword search, statistics, and matrix multiplication) in parallel, comparing performance to sequential execution. The user interface is built with Streamlit, and the backend leverages mpi4py for MPI operations.

## Features

- **Multiple Tasks:** Sorting, Word Count, Image Filtering, Linear Regression, Keyword Search, Statistics, Matrix Multiplication.
- **Parallel Execution:** Choose the number of MPI processes (2â€“32) to see the speedup over sequential processing.
- **User-Friendly Web UI:** Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Performance Comparison:** Displays execution time and speedup between sequential and parallel runs.

## How It Works (Backend Explanation)

### **A. Sequential vs. Parallel Execution**

- For each task, there are two implementations:
  - **Sequential:** Runs in a single process, used as a baseline.
  - **Parallel (MPI):** The data is split among multiple processes using mpi4py, and the results are combined at the end[1].

### **B. Task Execution Flow**

1. **User Input:** Data and parameters are collected from the UI.
2. **Sequential Run:** The task is executed in the main process for benchmarking.
3. **Parallel Run:** The app spawns an MPI job using `mpiexec` with the selected number of processes. The actual computation is distributed across processes, and results are gathered on the root process.
4. **Results & Timing:** Both results and timings are displayed, allowing users to compare performance.

## C. Task Execution Flow and Parallelization Details

This section explains, for each supported task, how the backend executes both the sequential and parallel (MPI) versions, including how data is split, processed, and aggregated.

### **C.1 Sorting**

**How it works:**
- The input array is divided among all MPI processes.
- Each process sorts its assigned chunk locally (using algorithms like MergeSort or Enumeration Sort).
- The sorted subarrays are then sent to a master process (often rank 0), which merges them into a single sorted array.
- The merging step compares elements from each subarray and builds the final sorted result[1].

**Parallelization:**
- Data is split evenly for load balancing.
- Communication between processes is managed using MPI_Send and MPI_Recv for sending/receiving sorted chunks[1].

### **C.2 Word Count**

**How it works:**
- The input text file is divided into sections, one per MPI process.
- Each process counts word occurrences in its section independently and stores results in a local hash table.
- After counting, each process sends its hash table to the master process.
- The master process merges all hash tables to get the final word counts for the entire file[2].

**Parallelization:**
- The workload is distributed so each process gets a nearly equal number of bytes to process.
- Overlaps at section boundaries are handled to avoid splitting words[2].

### **C.3 Image Filter**

**How it works:**
- The image is split into horizontal slices, one per MPI process.
- Each process applies the selected filter (e.g., grayscale, blur, or other OpenCV filters) to its slice[3].
- The filtered slices are gathered and combined to form the final processed image.

**Parallelization:**
- Each process works on a separate part of the image, enabling simultaneous filtering.
- The output image maintains the same dimensions as the input[3].

### **C.4 Linear Regression**

**How it works:**
- Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.
- In parallel, the dataset is divided among processes, each calculating partial sums needed for regression coefficients.
- The partial results are sent to the master process, which aggregates them and computes the final regression coefficients using the ordinary least squares method[4].

**Parallelization:**
- Each process works on a subset of the data, reducing computation time for large datasets.
- Communication is required to combine partial results for the final model.

---

### **C.5 Keyword Search**

**How it works:**
- The input text (or array of strings) is divided into slices, one per MPI process.
- Each process searches for the keyword in its assigned slice and records the positions or counts of matches.
- Results from all processes are sent to the master, which aggregates them and presents the final list of occurrences[5].

**Parallelization:**
- The search workload is distributed using MPI_Scatter.
- Each process works independently, and results are gathered at the end[5].

---

### **C.6 Statistics**

**How it works:**
- The dataset (e.g., a CSV file) is divided among processes by rows.
- Each process computes statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.) for its subset.
- The partial statistics are sent to the master, which combines them to get the overall statistics for the dataset.

**Parallelization:**
- Row-wise splitting ensures even distribution.
- Final aggregation may involve additional computation to combine partial statistics.

---

### **C.7 Matrix Multiplication**

**How it works:**
- Two matrices (A and B) are divided into blocks or rows.
- Each process computes a portion of the resulting matrix by multiplying its assigned rows of A with the corresponding columns of B.
- The computed blocks are sent to the master process, which assembles the final result.

**Parallelization:**
- Each process handles a segment of the multiplication, significantly speeding up computation for large matrices.
- Communication is needed to distribute data and gather results.

## Notes

- **Performance:** Speedup depends on the size of the data and the number of MPI processes. For small datasets, parallel overhead may outweigh benefits.
- **MPI Environment:** The app must be run in an environment where `mpiexec` is available and properly configured.
- **Platform:** Tested on Linux; some MPI implementations may behave differently on Windows.

---

## Extending the Project

- Add new data processing tasks by implementing both sequential and MPI versions.
- Improve front-end with more visualizations or input validation.
- Add support for larger datasets and streaming data.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to MPI, ensure your MPI installation is working (try `mpiexec -n 2 python -c "from mpi4py import MPI; print(MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())"`).
- For Python dependency issues, check your environment and reinstall required packages.
